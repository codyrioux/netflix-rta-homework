    "# Introduction\n",
    "At Netflix, we rely on Amazon's Auto Scaling to automatically scale service capacity up and down to meet demand. We believe auto scaling greatly improves the availability of our services and provides an excellent means of optimizing our cloud costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given the task of building a tool that automatically determines when a system starts to exhibit performance issues based on a set of streaming metrics. The goal is to determine a cut-off point when the service starts to behave in an non-predictable manner. For example, you might be interested in determining the number of requests per second (RPS) a service can handle before performance degradation occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, you are given a set of metrics which characterize system performance, for a service, over a one hour period. Your goal is to implement a streaming algorithm which correctly determines when the instance has \"had enough\", determine a timeout for this server and create some visualizations. Further descriptions of the tasks can be found below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution should produce the time stamp, an RPS value for the cutoff, acceptable timout value and associated visualizations. See below for further task descriptions for each of the individual tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Your solution does not have to use the imported libraries, feel free to use your own. It also does NOT have to be in this notebook, or even in python if you are more comfortable using another language. This notebook is just provided as a general framework to get you started."

The objective of this test is to determine at which RPS count the server instance can no longer handle further traffic. This will later assist us in setting up auto-scaling policies on this cluster.\n",

    "Lets imagine that we are streaming this data in, and the analytic must determine when the server instance has reached its limit of reasonable performance, triggering a signal to terminate the squeeze test and return the RPS at the time of termination. Given that we are 'streaming' the data we must perform the analysis time-step by time-step without looking ahead in the data.\n",
